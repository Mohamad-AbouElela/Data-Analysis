In this jupyter notebook we explore - The Movie Database (TMDb) - dataset which contains information about 10,000+ movies including user ratings, budgets and revenues and much more... I want to explore, find and share answers for many questions on this notebook. 

I will try to answer these questions during this interesting exploration:
* Top Ten Directors, Actors, Production Companies and Movie Genres ?
* What is the Movies popularity trend over years ?
* Which genres was more populare over the years ?
* Compare lowest and highest Movies Budgets, Revenues, Profites and Runtime ?
* Check the properities of Top 100 Revenue Movies ?
